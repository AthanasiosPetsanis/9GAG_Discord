# 9GAG_Discord

This is a Flask project that is deployed on Render and basically I have the domain 69gag.xyz which is just an input field where you put an 9gag .mp4 and it makes it into a Discord embeddable mp4 (because most 9gag .mp4 do not embed in Discord by default).

So you just copy the video link of the 9gag video
Paste it in 69gag.xyz website
It transcodes it to H264
Returns the new link
You post in Discord
Boom it works
(I am on a free Render plan, which has limitations and the service goes down due to inactivity, but I'll try to figure out a fix)
